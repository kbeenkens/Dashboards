# Dashboards

A collection of (tokenized) LogicMonitor dashboards that can be re-used across accounts. When importing, change the value of the ##defaultResourceGroup## or ##defaultResourceName## token to select the relevant group of devices (or individual device) for which you wish to visualize data. Intended to be examples to get the creativity flowing! (LogicMonitor Support can always help with adjustments)

These dashboards largely rely on both the latest versions of LogicMonitor datasources, and dynamic groups in the 'Devices by Type' device group. If these groups don't exist, they can be created using the out-of-box PropertySources from LogicMonitor together with the below documentation. [So make sure you have the latest PropertySources (and DataSources) from the repository!](https://www.logicmonitor.com/support/settings/logicmodules/keeping-your-datasources-up-to-date/)

To see a preview of what some of these dashboards look like, visit the [LogicMonitor Dashboard Gallery](https://www.logicmonitor.com/sales/dashboards/index.html).
